They are very kind and caring but also professional and really know their stuff. My mother likes both of them too! Highly recommend P.A. Homecare Services.",

    full: "He had a stroke and is in a wheelchair now and had become quite reserved. He spends much more time out of the house now and is more happy and conversational. It is a joy to see. They look for what needs doing and do it rather than just doing what is on the care plan. The house has never looked as tidy and they keep on top of medication and food. We have experienced a number of care companies and Roz and Mark are the best we have worked with by some distance. They really care, if that makes sense.",

    short: "Roz and Mark have really improved our dad’s quality of life",
    full: "since they took over his care. They have a great relationship with him and bring out the best in him. He had a stroke some time ago and lost his wife a few years ago too so sometimes gets very low in mood. Roz and Mark brought his enjoyment for life back. They go above and beyond looking after our dad and taking the initiative around the house. I feel that they look after him so well that they actually look after us all by extension.",
